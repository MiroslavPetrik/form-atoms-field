Declarative & headless form fields build on top of [`jotai & form-atoms`](https://github.com/jaredLunde/form-atoms).

```
yarn add @react-last-field/field
```

### What's in the box?

The `form-atoms` library provides atomic form primitives capable of tracking input value, touch state, validation status and more.

`react-last-field` extends these primitives & packages them into hooks & headless components (think 'smart components'), which can be easily wired to UI (think dumb components) checkbox, select or array field.

### What is a `<LastField />`?

Most UI libraries provide styled primitive input components, form labels and form controls. These must be integrated together with state & validation libraries, so when the input value is invalid, the error is propagated to the form control or the label is colored to red. The work to get this right is non-trivial and error prone.

`react-last-field` provides you with **integrated LastField components** so it will be the last time you do it.

### Integrations

`react-last-field` comes with `<LastFields />` pre-wired to popular UI libraries.
