# `booleanField(): ValidatedFieldAtom<boolean | undefined>`

A field which will have `true`, `false` or `undefined` value.
You can think of it like 3-state checkbox. Sometimes, you can't initialize form with `false` checkbox, as the user must explicitly pick
yes/no answer. This field starts in 'unanswered' state.

```ts
import { booleanField } from "@form-atoms/field";

// required yes/no answer, value must be changed by user to true or false
const yesNoAnswer = booleanField({
  name: "agreesWithFuneralTerms"
  required_error: "Please click yes or no button.",
});
```
