# A Field is pre-configured `fieldAtom`

The `form-atoms` library exposes generic `fieldAtom()` API, which can be used to store any input value.
Besides input values, `fieldAtoms` hold input metadata such as touched and dirty state, or the input's `ref`.

However in a real application, we need specific field atoms for all the various data types such as `booleanFieldAtom` for checkboxes
or `fileFieldAtom` for file inputs. Moreover all the specific data types require specific adaptations to inputs. For example the `boolean` field
should supply input's `checked` prop instead of `value` prop. Or the `file` input value must be controlled manually, as `<input type="file" />` is uncontrolled in React.

`@form-atoms/field` library provides such prefabricated data fields, alongside with useful hooks which handle the repetitive work for you.

## Features of form-atoms fields

### Controllable `required` property

We extend the default `fieldAtom` with a `required` state. This allows us to specify optional & required `zod` validators for the most common cases.
All the data fields are of type `ValidatedFieldAtom` which extends the default `FieldAtom`.
Finally, the `required` state is used on UI layer to display requirement indicators to users or to set `aria` properties.

### `undefined` as empty values

When users leave your optional fields untouched, you will receive `undefined` values in the form submit data.

### Pre-defined `zod` validators

Our fields know whether they are required or optional. Based on that they have pre-set validation functions.
This saves you time, provides runtime safety, and will error when you use a data field with mismatching input type.

### Naming

Unlike `form-atoms` our field constructor functions do not have the `atom` suffix, as the field is in reality an aggregation of dozen jotai atoms.
